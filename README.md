# **Convo Sphere**
**Convo Sphere** is a real-time chat application designed for dynamic and responsive conversations. It integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for live sentiment analysis, allowing users to understand the tone and sentiment of messages in real-time. Built with **Gatsby** and **Firebase** for a fast and scalable experience, Convo Sphere aims to provide a seamless chat platform with robust features like user authentication and a responsive UI.

The above diagram illustrates the core components and their interactions in the Convo Sphere system:
- **Client Layer (Gatsby)** handles the frontend with Chakra UI components
- **Firebase Services** manage authentication and real-time data
- **NLP Service** processes message sentiment using VADER and TextBlob
- **Continuous Deployment** ensures smooth updates via Vercel

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Chat**: Provides a smooth, real-time messaging experience with Firebase's real-time database.
- **User Authentication**: Supports Google and email-based sign-ins using Firebase Auth. Includes options for guest login and account creation.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes message sentiments in real time using NLP libraries (VADER and TextBlob), offering users insights into the tone of their conversations.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Chakra UI to ensure an adaptable and user-friendly interface across devices.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel, with continuous integration for seamless and efficient updates.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: Gatsby (React-based framework for static sites)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Real-time database and authentication)
- **NLP Libraries**: VADER and TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)
- **UI**: Chakra UI (for responsive design)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (for deployment and continuous integration)

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
